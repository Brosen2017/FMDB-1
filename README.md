This component was a mockup of the IMDB main webpage. I utilized AWS,Loader.io, Artillery.io, MongoDB and PostgreSQL to Seed and optimize the backend to handle up to 10million queries at a time.

Utilizing NginX and 5 seperate instance with 3 servers, I was able to achieve 2000+ RPS at a sub 1% error rate.
